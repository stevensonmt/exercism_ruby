*These are my solutions to the problems posed on exercism's ruby track.*

I want to thank the creators and maintainers of exercism for the wonderful opportunity they are providing for those interested in learning to code.  I encourage everyone with any interest to take advantage of their service.

Anyone interested in seeing the iterations I went through before arriving at these final solutions can check my submissions at [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).  This git was initialized after many of these solutions were finalized, so tracking iterations via git commits is not possible prior to the date this repo was initializled (1/15/17).

Comments and suggestions for improving my code are welcomed.
